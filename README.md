# Privacy-Preserving Intrusion Detection: A Federated Learning Approach with Convolutional Neural Networks and Random Resampling (KDD Dataset)

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook implementation of a privacy-preserving intrusion detection system using Federated Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks and Random Resampling. This project was presented at the 2nd BÄ°LSEL International Scientific Research Congress in Diyarbakir, Turkey.

**Key Features:**

* **Federated Learning:** Preserves data privacy by training a model on decentralized data.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks:** Efficiently extracts features from network traffic data.
* **Random Resampling:** Addresses class imbalance issues in the KDD dataset.

**To Run the Notebook:**

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_name]
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the notebook:** Open **Intrusion Detection Centrelized.ipynb** or **Intrusion Detection Federated Learning.ipynb** in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
